# When to Use Access Control<a name="sns-when-to-use-access-control"></a>

You have a great deal of flexibility in how you grant or deny access to a resource\. However, the typical use cases are fairly simple: 
+ You want to grant another AWS account a particular type of topic action \(for example, Publish\)\. For more information, see [Grant AWS Account Access to a Topic](sns-access-policy-use-cases.md#sns-grant-aws-account-access-to-topic)\.
+ You want to limit subscriptions to your topic to only the HTTPS protocol\. For more information, see [Limit Subscriptions to HTTPS](sns-access-policy-use-cases.md#sns-limit-subscriptions-to-https)\.
+ You want to allow Amazon SNS to publish messages to your Amazon SQS queue\. For more information, see [Publish Messages to an Amazon SQS Queue](sns-access-policy-use-cases.md#sns-publish-messages-to-sqs-queue)\.

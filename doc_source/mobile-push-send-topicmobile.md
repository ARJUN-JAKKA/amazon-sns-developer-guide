# Send Messages to Mobile Devices Subscribed to a Topic<a name="mobile-push-send-topicmobile"></a>

You can also use Amazon SNS to send messages to mobile endpoints subscribed to a topic\. The concept is the same as subscribing other endpoint types, such as Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, email, and SMS, to a topic, as described in [What is Amazon Simple Notification Service?](welcome.md)\. The difference is that Amazon SNS communicates through the notification services in order for the subscribed mobile endpoints to receive notifications sent to the topic\.

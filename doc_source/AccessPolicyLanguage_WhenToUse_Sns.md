You have a great deal of flexibility in how you grant or deny access to a resource\. However, the typical use cases are fairly simple: 
+ You want to grant another AWS account a particular type of topic action \(e\.g\., Publish\)\. For more information, see [Allowing AWS account Access to a Topic](AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCases_Sns.md#AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCase1_Sns)\.
+ You want to limit subscriptions to your topic to only the HTTPS protocol\. For more information, see [Limiting Subscriptions to HTTPS](AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCases_Sns.md#AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCase2_Sns)\.
+ You want to allow Amazon SNS to publish messages to your Amazon SQS queue\. For more information, see [Publishing to an Amazon SQS Queue](AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCases_Sns.md#AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCase3_Sns)\.
